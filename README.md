# Git Hub Repo Finder
A mini github repo search utility using React, Node and TypeScript

There are 2 folders `api` and `ui`
We are using the yarn package manager to manage dependencies in each folder

## API

To spin up the API run the following commands

### `cd api`
### `yarn`
### `yarn run dev`

This will start the API by default on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## UI

To spin up the UI run the following commands in another terminal

### `cd ui`
### `yarn`
### `yarn start`

This will start the UI by default on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

These commands will start the project in dev mode.

For more info on how to build for production and other scenarios, please see the README.md file from within each subfolder.


I plan to flesh out the tests a bit more for this.
I want to include cypress for e2e testing, add a few more component tests in the UI, and add some unit and integration tests in the API
